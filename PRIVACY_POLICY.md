# Privacy Policy for Context Notes

**Last Updated:** December 26, 2025

Context Notes ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and discloses your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**Context Notes does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

- **Local Storage:** All notes you create are stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
- **Context Awareness:** To function, the extension accesses the URL of the tab you are currently viewing only when you interact with the extension or when it checks for existing notes to display the indicator. This data is processed locally and never sent to us.

## 2. Permissions

We request the following permissions to provide the extension's core functionality:

- **`activeTab`**: To access the URL and title of the current page when you open the extension, allowing us to link your note to that specific page.
- **`storage`**: To save your notes and settings locally on your device.
- **`Host Permissions` (`<all_urls>`)**: Required to display the "note indicator" (📝) on any webpage where you have previously saved a note.

## 3. Third-Party Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. Since we do not collect any user data, there is no data to share.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
